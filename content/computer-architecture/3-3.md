## Division
If the length of Dividend and Divisor is **M** and **N**, </br>
the length of Quotient $\leqq$ M - N + 1 & the length of Remainder $ \leqq$ N
- In MIPS-based computers, 32 bits are used to represent both Dividend and Divisor. </br>Therefore, the length of both Quotient and Remainder $\leqq$ 32
</br>

### Optimized version of the division HW
- 32-bit divisor register / ALU
- 64-bit remainder register (dividend and quotient shares a register with remainder)
    - `HI`: Remainder
    - `LO`: Quotient

</br>

### Settings
- 0 is stored in the left half of the Remainder register
- The value of dividend is loaded into the right half of the Remainder register
- The value of divisor is loaded into the Divisor register
</br>

</br>

#### Example
When N = 4 (4-bit ALU / divisor, 8-bit product), $7 \div 3$
- should be **repeated as many bits + 1 as it is**

</br>

### Signed division
Do division after converting both divisor & dividend to positives </br>
After the division
- Negate the quotient only if the signs of the divisor and dividend are different
- Remainder's sign follows Dividend's sign
</br>

### Instructions
- `div rs, rt / divu rs, rt` : do `$rs` / `$st`
    - The result (remainder and quotient) is stored in `HI` / `LO`
    - No overflow or divide-by-0 checking

</br>

#### Example: 
- Initially, the value in `$t0` (dividend) is loaded into the `LO` register
- Initially, `$t` (divisor) is used as the divisor register
- Then, do the division and store the remainder and quotient to `HI` and `LO` registers

## Summary: Design for arithmetic operations
### Addition & Subtraction
Use the same HW for addition and subtraction
- 32-bit parallel adder
- Additional XOR operators + subtract bit

### Multiplication & Division
Use the same optimized HW for Multiplication and Division
- A single 32-bit register for multiplicand and divisor
- A single 32-bit `ALU`
- `HI` and `LO` registers for the results of multiplication and division
