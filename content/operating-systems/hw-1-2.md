### Various Topics from Programming Assignments


### how to print characters to the screen.

#### VGA text mode

#### the text mode video memory address

#### how to make characters appear with a background and foreground color (you will not have to know the color values).


### how to call a function written in assembly from C. (from = 에서)
(C에서 어셈블리로 작성된 함수를 호출하는 방법)

#### how to write a function in assembly that accesses values passed as parameters in C.
(C에서 매개 변수로 전달된 값에 액세스하는 함수를 어셈블리에서 쓰는 방법.) Calling Assembly From C

if you use it from C source code (in another file), define as global in your assembly 

```
GLOBAL myfunction ;in your assembly
```
compile the assembly source to an object file

```
kernel_asm.o: kernel.asm
	nasm -g -f elf -F dwarf -o kernel_asm.o kernel.asm
```
Tell the assembler that the symbol is defined in another file. 
```
EXTERN myfunction ;in c
```
compile and link the C program with gcc
```
kernel_c.o: kernel.c
	gcc -g -m32 -fno-stack-protector -c -o kernel_c.o kernel.c 
```

#### how to call a function written in C from assembly
Calling C from Assembly

extern 선언하고 call로 쓰기

#### how to pass parameters to the C function.



### How and why the build process works

For example,

#### why you strip the binary with objcopy

the use of strip can improve the security of the binary 

#### why segment directives are not useful for our OS code.

because Objcopy will strip out section information

    You will ***not*** have to know the specific commands of the build process (the gcc, objcopy, ld, and nasm, mformat, etc.syntax).

    Be able to identify the steps of the build process.


### the boot procedure for your OS

#### from powering up
#### booting up in real mode (BIOS)
#### loading the boot loader from sector 0 into memory location 0x7c00 (BIOS)
#### loading your boot2 file (boot1, the boot loader)
#### putting the computer into protected mode (boot1, the boot loader)
#### to finally jumping to the first instruction in boot2 (boot1, the boot loader)
