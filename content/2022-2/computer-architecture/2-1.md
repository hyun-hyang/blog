## MIPS ISA
### What is MIPS ISA
- Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages
- A kind of ISA

### Design principles
1. **Simplicity favors regularity**
2. **Smaller is faster**
3. **Make the common case fast** 
</br>

## Design Principle 1
### Simplicity favors regularity
- **Regularity**: all MIPS arithmetic instructions include **a single operation & three operands** </br>
- Regularity makes implementation simpler </br>
- Simplicity enables higher performance at lower cost 

### Examples
- add a, b, c
    - $a = b + c$
- sub a, a, d
    - $a = a - d$
</br>

## Design Principle 2
### Smaller is faster
- Operands of MIPS arithmetic instructions must be chosen in **a small number of registers**
- **Register**: Fast locations for data
- 32 32-bit registers in MIPS
- 32 is $2^5$ that can be represented by using 5 bits

## Practice 1
**C code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-default">
<code>f = (g + h) - (i + j)
</code></pre>

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-default">
<code>add $t0, $s1, $s2
add $t1, $s3, $s4
sub $s0, $t0, $t1
</code></pre>
</br>

## Memory instruction
### Memory organization
keep a small amount data in **registers** and other remaining, complex data in **memory**

- **Load** values from memory into registers
- **Store** results from registers to memory

### Address
A memory address is an index to the memory array, starting at 0 </br>
MIPS uses byte addressing (Each address identifies an 8-bit byte)

**But**, most data items are larger than a byte. So, they use "**words**" </br>
- In MIPS, a ward is 32 bits
- Registers also hold 32-bit of data

#### Alignment restrictions
- The start address of each data should be multiple of N, where N is the size of the data
- In MIPS, words must start at a addresses that are multiples of 4
- Some data items use one or two bytes (halfword)

#### Byte ordering
- Big endian(**MIPS**): place the most significant byte first and the least significant byte last
- Little endian: place the least significant byte first and the most significant byte last  

### Load/Store
- **lw reg1 offset(reg2)**: Load 32-bit word from the memory address reg2 + offset into reg1
- **sw reg1 offset(reg2)**: Store 32-bit word in reg1 at the memory address reg2 + offset
- **lh/sh** and **lb/sb** instructions load/store halfwords and 8-bit of data

## Practice 2
**C code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>g = h + A[8]
</code></pre>
- A is an array of 4-bytes words
- The value of g and h are in `$s1` and `$s2`
- The base address of A is in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>lw $t0, 32($s3)
add $s1, $s2, $t0
</code></pre>
</br>

## Practice 2
**C code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>A[12] = h+ A[8]
</code></pre>
- A is an array of 4-bytes words
- The value of h is in `$s2`
- The base address of A is in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>lw $t0, 32($s3)
add $t0, $s2, $t0
sw $t0, 48($s3)
</code></pre>
</br>

## Practice 3
**C code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>f = (g + h) - (i + j)
</code></pre>
- f, g, and h are in `$s0`, `$s1`, and `$2` respectively
- Halfwords i and j are sequentially stored in memory
- The start address of i is stored in `$s3`

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code class="prose-code:text-yellow-400
            prose-code:text-sm 
            prose-code:font-normal">add $t0, $s1, $s2
lh $t1, 0($s3)
lh $t2, 2($s3)
add $t3, $t1, $t2
sub $s2, $t0, $t3
</code></pre>
</br>

## Design Principle 3
### Make the common case fast
**Common case :** a program uses a small constant in an operation many times </br>

**Solution: support** </br>
- **16-bit immediate operands** for handling the constants
    - no need to access memory to load the constants
    - `addi $t0, $t0, 4` : addi is an add immediate instruction
- **MIPS register 0 (`$zero`)** contains the constant 0
    - `add $t0, $t1, $zero` : move values between two registers `$t0` and `t1`

## Practice 4
**C code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code>f = A[10] - i + 4
</code></pre>
- `A` is an array of bytes and its base address is stored in `$s0`
- `f` and `i` are stored in `$s1` and `$s2` respectively 

**Compiled MIPS assembly language code:**
<pre class="no-line-numbers language-bash">
<code class="prose-code:text-yellow-400
            prose-code:text-sm 
            prose-code:font-normal">lb $t0, 10($s0)
sub $t1, $t0, $s2
addi $s1, $t1, 4
</code></pre>
</br>
