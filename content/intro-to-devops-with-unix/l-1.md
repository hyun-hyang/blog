`ls`

- show all the files at your current location

`ls-a`

- show *hidden files* also 
- hidden file : a file begin with a dot

`ls -al`

- show *meta data details*  of a files in present working directory
- meta data details : permission info

`pwd`

- present working directory
- gives you the absolute path

</br>

#### Difference between a relative path and an absolute path

- **absolute pathname** starts from the **root** directory and leads to its destination
- **relative pathname** starts from the **working directory**
- /(root)로 시작하면 절대경로, 그외는 전부 상대경로

#### root directory

- **first** directory in the file system
- "Slash(/)"  

#### changing to your(username's) home directory

절대경로:

- cd /home/Alice

상대경로:

- cd ~
  - ~(tildae) 뒤에 username은 생략가능, because program knows who you are
- cd
  
#### how to handle whitespace in the folder name

- ''로 감싸기 ex) 'CSC 2510'

#### present working directory가 주어졌을때 이동

- cd ../
- 상위폴더로 나가기
