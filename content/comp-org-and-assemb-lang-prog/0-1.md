## Grading

| Category       | Percentage | Delivery Date                 | 
| -------------- | ---------- |------------------------------ |
| Assignments (4)| 50% |                                      |
| Exam (3)       | 50% |                                      |

- Your programming assignments should reflect good programming practices. For example, you should use the appropriate data structures and their implementations should be efficient. Examples of poor programming practices include implementing order n appends and pop_front operations for a data structure that supports constant time append and pop_front, spaghetti code (particularly if you are using assembly language), and little or no thought for design (e.g. not collecting like functions into modules/classes). Poor programming practices will result in a reduction in your grade. </br>

- For a programming assignment, the instructor may ask you to create a makefile. The make utility will use your makefile to automatically compile and run your applications. It is your responsibility to become familiar with the make utility and makefiles (this utility is standard on Unix systems and can be found on MS Windows systems having a C/C++ compiler installed).
