## Two metrics for defining computer performances
1. Response time
    - The time between the start and completion of a task
    - related to single task
    - e.g., how long it takes to do a single task
2. Throughput
    - A total amount of works done per unit time
    - related to multiple tasks
    - e.g., tasks per hour
</br>

**Q. If we replace the processor in a computer with ad faster version**
- Response time **decrease**
- Throughput **increase**

**Q. If we add more processors to a system**
- Response time **maintain or increase** (more lanes more complex)
- Throughput **increase**
</br>

## Defining performance
- $Performance = \frac{1}{execution\;time\,(reponse\;time)}$ 
- Relative performance: **X is N time faster than Y**
- $ \frac{Performance_x}{Performance_y} = \frac{Execution time_y}{Execution time_x} = N$

- Elapsed time = system performance = **t1 + t2 + t3 + t4**
    - total time between the start and completion of a task, **including everything**
- CPU time = CPU performance = **t1 + t4** *(Only this in this class)*
    - The time spent **processing** a given task **on a processor**


$$
Performance = CPU\;performance = \frac{1}{CPU\;time}
$$

</br>

The CPU time can be further divided into
- **User CPU time**
    - spent for processing the code of the program (some functions)
- **System CPU time**
    - spent in the operating system performing tasks for the program (OS)
