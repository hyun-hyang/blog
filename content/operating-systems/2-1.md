#### Operating System
An OS is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between applications and the computer hardware.


#### What are the main objectives of an OS?
Convenience, efficiency, ability to evolve


#### System Programs
Aka utilities/library programs.  
These implement frequently used functions that assist in program creation, the management of files, and the control of I/O devices.  
A programmer will make use of these facilities in developing an application, and the application, while it is running, will invoke the utilities to perform certain functions.


#### Operating System Services
Program Development, Program Execution, Access I/O devices, Controlled Access to files, System Access, Error detection and response


#### 3 Types of Interfaces
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Application Binary Interface (ABI), Application Programming Interface (API)


##### Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
Defines a set of machine language instructions that a computer can follow. This is the boundary between hardware and software


###### Application Binary Interface (ABI)
Defines a standard for binary portability across programs. Defines the system call interface to the operating system and the hardware resources and services available in a system through the user ISA

##### Application Programming Interface (API)
Gives a program access to the hardware resources and services available in a system through the user ISA supplemented with high-level language library calls


#### An Operating System will evolve over time because/for...
Hardware upgrades, new types of hardware, new services, fixes


#### How did serial processing work on early computers?
Programmers interacted directly with the computer hardware.  
These computers were run from a console consisting of display lights, toggle switches, some form of input device, and a printer. Programs in machine code were loaded via the input device (e.g. a card reader).  
If an error halted the program, the error condition was indicated by the lights.  
If the program proceeded to a normal completion, the output appeared on the printer.


#### What were two problems with serial processing in early computers?
1. Scheduling -  
   People had to sign up to use a computer at a certain time, but their jobs might finish too early (causing downtime) or too late (resulting in the job having to be stopped).
2. Setup Time

#### Simple Batch System
Users submit a job on cards or tape to a computer operator, who batches the jobs together sequentially and places the entire batch on an input device for use by the monitor.  
After a job is finished, the monitor automatically begins loading the next program


#### Resident monitor
The portion of the monitor that is in main memory to be available for execution.


#### Monitor
controls the sequence of events in a Simple Batch System



#### "Control is passed to a job"
The processor is now fetching and executing instructions **in a user program**


#### "Control is returned to the monitor"
the processor is now fetching and executing instruction **from the monitor program**


#### Job Control Language (JCL)
A special type of programming language used to provide instructions to the monitor.


#### What are four desirable hardware features?
1. Memory protection for monitor (Prevents the user program from altering the memory area containing the monitor)
2. Timer (Prevents a job from monopolizing the system 
3. Privileged instructions (Can only be executed by the monitor. For example, I/O instructions) 
4. Interrupts (gives OS more flexibility in controlling user programs)

#### User Mode (of Operation)
Certain areas of memory are protected from the user's use and from instruction execution.


#### Kernel Mode (of Operation)
Also called system mode, privileged instructions may be executed and protected areas of memory may be accessed


#### Simple Batch System Overhead
1. Some main memory is given to the monitor
2. Some processor time is consumed by the monitor


#### Uniprogramming
The execution of a single program at a time.  
The processor spends a certain amount of time executing program A.  
It reaches an I/O instruction, and it must wait until it concludes before proceeding with program A.

#### Multiprogramming
The execution of multiple programs at a time.  
Multiple programs are loaded into memory, but only one of them runs at a time.  
If process A needs to wait for an I/O, process B can run in the meantime.  
This saves time, but requires more memory.


#### Time Sharing System
Multiple users can access the system at the same time through the terminals.  
The OS will interleave the execution of each user program in a short burst or quantum of computations.  
Each user will have access to 1/n of the effective computer capacity (where n is the number of users)


#### Batch Multiprogramming vs. Time Sharing
Batch Multiprogramming 
 - **maximize** **processor** use
 - uses **JCL** commands provided with the **job**.
  
Time Sharing
 - **minimize** response **time**  
 - uses **commands** entered at the **terminal**


#### Compatible Time-Sharing Systems
One of the first time-sharing OS's.  
Ran on a computer with 32,000 36-bit words of main memory.  
The Resident Monitor consumed 5,000 of that.  
For simplicity, programs were always loaded to start at the location of the 5,000th word.  
Used time slicing


#### Time Slicing
System clock generated interrupts every 0.2 seconds.  
At this point, the OS regained control and could assign the processor to another user.  
At regular time intervals, the current user would be preempted and another user loaded in.  
Old user programs and data were written out to disk and new user programs and data were read in.  
Old user programs and data were restored in main memory when that program was given a turn


#### Four major advances in the development of OS
Processes, Memory Management, Information Protection and security, Scheduling and Resource Management


#### What is a Process?
Simple definition - A program in execution.  
More complicated definition - A unit of activity characterized by a single sequential thread of execution, a current state, and an associated set of system resources
