#### Discuss the beautification principle (i.e. the operating system as a user/computer interface). What kind of services should the operating system provide? Describe the resource management principle (i.e. the operating system as an efficient resource manager). What is the kernel?


#### Why do operating systems need to change over time? What affect does this have on design?


#### Discuss how operating system have changed over the years. Describe serial processing. What was so bad about this model? Describe batch systems. What is a resident monitor? What is JCL? Describe multiprogrammed batch systems and how they were an improvement over simple batch systems in terms of efficiency. Describe time sharing.


#### Discuss the major achievements in operating systems. In particularly, be able to describe processes and the problems they helped solve. What is process state?


#### Discuss achievements in memory management. Discuss the five principle storage management responsibilities. What is a real address? A virtual address? Know what virtual memory is (but you do not have to know how it works; we'll cover that later).


#### Know that advances for operating systems have occurred in information protection and security Be able to discuss areas of availability, confidentiality, data integrity, and authenticity.


#### Discuss achievements scheduling and resource management. Discuss fairness, differential responsiveness, and efficiency.


#### Discuss advances in system structure. Describe a layered architecture. Discuss the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel. Know the difference between a thread and a process.


#### See *Review Questions* 2.1 through 2.11. I could ask you to do problems from Section 2.13 *Problems* like 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (8th edition)
